## People, not things

Aim to show the impact of our products and services on customers, rather than the products or services themselves.

## Daylight, not cosy

Photographs should use a cool colour temperature. Shoot in natural daylight were possible, or with cool lighting. Keeping colour grading consistent allows us to use photos together in new and interesting combinations.

## Use negative space

If you plan to overlay text onto a photo (e.g. on a flyer) make sure there are areas of open, plain background (“negative space”) in the photo. If there are people in the photo, get them to look or point in the direction of where your content will be placed.
