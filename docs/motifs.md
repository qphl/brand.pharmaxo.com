<p class="docs-text--large">The Pharmaxo group branding uses two visual motifs to harmonise its materials. Circles borrow from our logo, while crops of our logo add interest and flexibility.</p>

---

## Circles

Using circles in branding and signage brings the shape of our roundel into your branded materials, and can be easier to work with than the mode complicated crops.

## Crops

Six close crops of the Pharmaxo roundel can be used as block colours, tints or image masks to add interest and character to branded materials.

These six crops are available in square, portrait and landscape variants.

Tips:

* Donâ€™t stretch or distort the crops. If you need to fill a page, scale the crop instead.
* Avoid clashing colours when composing materials using crops. Colours from the same hue work well together.
* Consider using the crops as image masks or translucent overlays on images.
