<p class="docs-text--large">The Pharmaxo group uses the font Inter by Rasmus Andersson. Inter is installed on company computers by default. Use it whenever possible for internal or external communications. If Inter is unavailable, or the application requires another font, use Arial instead.</p>

If Inter is not available on your computer but you have permission to install fonts, you can download it for free from [https://rsms.me/inter/](https://rsms.me/inter/).

## Font sizes and weights

Where possible, use:

* A minimum font size of 14px for screen content
* A minimum font size of 10pt for print content
* A minimum line height of 1.5 for screen content
* A minimum line height of 1.2 for print content
* Use font weights sparingly. For documents, only use Regular (400) and Bold (700).
