<p class="docs-text--large">The Pharmaxo group uses a logo system that applies to the group and its specialist companies. The common brand aims to have a single, unified identity that our customers and the public will recognise.</p>

---

The group comprises several specialist companies. These have their logos derived from the logo system. These brand guidelines apply equally to the group and its specialist companies.

## Logo colour variants

There are four colour variants of each logo to suit different situations. Use the correct variant for your application to make sure it is legible.

* Use the colour logos with black text on white or very light backgrounds.
* Use the colour logos with white text on black or very dark backgrounds.
* Use the black logos on light backgrounds.
* Use the white logos on dark backgrounds.

</figure>

Tips:

* Judge on a case-by-case basis which colour variant you should use.
* Never place the logo over a noisy background.
* Use the black variant if you suspect the logo will be printed in back and white (for example, on product labels).

## Logo layout variants

In rare and exceptional circumstances it may be necessary to use a compact, inline variant of a logo. Check with the marketing team before using these variants.

## Exclusion zones

The logos need space around them to stand out and be easily recognised. Don’t put any other content closer to a logo than half its height. For example, if the logo is 2cm tall, don’t place anything within 1cm of it.

## Profile pictures

Use the same avatar image for all group or specialist company profile pictures (for example, social media pages), provided it always appears adjacent to the company name.

Tips:

* Websites use different shaped profile pictures. Always use a square avatar and rely on the website to apply its own border radius.
